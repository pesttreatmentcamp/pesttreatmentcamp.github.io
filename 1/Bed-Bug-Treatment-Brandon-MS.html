The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than products that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
