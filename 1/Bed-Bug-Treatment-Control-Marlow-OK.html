Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like roaches, spiders, or ants, we will determine the source of the issue. The objective is to provide a general understanding of the concepts of IPM, together with the principles for application in all crops. When a crop is under stress it can be less capable of handling the stress triggered by insects that extract plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress might somewhat lower the economic limit.</p>

Controlling pests can be performed in numerous ways but an effective way is to clean out the bugs frequently. In this guide we specify conventional or chemical insecticides as those having a broad spectrum of activity and being more damaging to natural enemies.</p>
