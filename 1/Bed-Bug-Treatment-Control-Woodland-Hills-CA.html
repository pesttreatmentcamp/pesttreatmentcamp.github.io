<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an environment technique to crop production and security that integrates various management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and decrease the use of pesticides. When an IPM program has been executed effectively, significant decreases in the volumes and toxicity of pesticides used can be attained.
