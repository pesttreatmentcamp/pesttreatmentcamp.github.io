<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. However family pests can also be a threat to your household. When trying to find a location to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>

If you provide any scenario with pests, companies with emergency numbers will be the best ones to hire because they will be ready for you. This topic is dis- cussed in Chapter 18. Certain pesticide residues might stay in the environment for years. Pests increase in number very quickly, making it chaos to get rid of.
