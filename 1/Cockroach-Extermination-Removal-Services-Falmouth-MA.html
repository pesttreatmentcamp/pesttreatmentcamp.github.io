<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, environment control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>

Much better sleep, as sleep, is typically disturbed when you understand that pests are crawling about. Increasing yields on the existing farming land base whilst protecting biodiversity and the environment has actually never ever been more crucial as the international population increases and need for food and pressure on natural deposits grows.</p>
