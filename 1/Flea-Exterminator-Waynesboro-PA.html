<p>Utilizing natural opponents as an alleviative control is less successful compared to applying them preventively.

<p>Crop varieties can vary considerably in their susceptibility to pests and illness.

In concept, natural opponents used in these methodologies are biopesticides, and the basic methods differ from standard pesticidal applications only in the type of items utilized. Biological control - biological control in organic plant defense is a technique of managing insect pests and illness utilizing other organisms which depend on predation, herbivory and parasitism, or some other natural systems with active farmer's management interaction.</p>
