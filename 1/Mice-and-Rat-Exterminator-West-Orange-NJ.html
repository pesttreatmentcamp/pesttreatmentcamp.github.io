<p>The red imported fire ant is a frustrating and popular pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after routine tracking suggests that a pest population had actually reached a financial threshold level. Many individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited locations.</p>
<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dosage when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
