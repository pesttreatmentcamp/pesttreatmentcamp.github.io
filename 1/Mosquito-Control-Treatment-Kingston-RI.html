The idea of integrated pest management (IPM) originated practically 60 years ago in response to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Numerous of the resources noted at the end of this leaflet can be used for recognition of insect pests affecting collections.</p>
<p>All at once, it is likewise based on semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are driven away or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or removed 35 (Figure 5 ).

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
