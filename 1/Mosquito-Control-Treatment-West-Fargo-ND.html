Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than common baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property likewise have actually proven to greatly decrease the total volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural enemies that are helpful to the landscape.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of incorporating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
