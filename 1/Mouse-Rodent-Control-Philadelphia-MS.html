IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all methods. This chapter goes over different techniques to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and pets far from areas where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators utilize various types of pesticides and baits to kill and remove pests. Reliable, irreversible corrective actions can then be taken to avoid pests from going into the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
