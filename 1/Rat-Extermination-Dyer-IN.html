<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as damaging to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.

<h3>Fire Ant Facts and Pest Control Dyer IN</h3>
<p>It uses a mix of practices and control techniques with the aim of avoiding issues from happening and reducing the requirement for pesticide extensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Also, consider policies and procedures that may unintentionally present pests: storage practices and devices, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. The term was later widened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (13 ). Consequently, under the term IPM," various authors have actually advocated the concept of including the full selection of pest management practices together with production goals into an overall systems method.</p>
<p>It is very challenging to manage certain plant diseases and arthropod pests through nonchemical means in some crops (Flinckh et al. 2006 ). Inadequate control not only leads to crop losses, but can result in their spread to larger areas making their control even more challenging.
