If you have a termite invasion at home, do not waste too much time before you call for termite pest control as the damages caused by these insects are very expensive to fix.</p>

Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
