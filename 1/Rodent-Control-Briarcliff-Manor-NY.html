<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest determination include intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
