<p>The 4 major problems encountered with standard pesticides are hazardous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are urged and synthetic pesticides need to just be utilized as a last option or just utilized as needed and frequently just at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>Monitoring and recognition reduces the risks of utilizing the wrong kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more efficient.
