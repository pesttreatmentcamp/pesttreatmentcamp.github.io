Maybe biological control is most understood for importation of natural opponents, often from the pest's location of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were attacking California citrus orchards).</p>
<p>This may include using numerous pesticides with various modes of action. Trap crops are planted to hold and attract pest insects where they can be handled more efficiently and prevent or decrease their motion onto important crops.
