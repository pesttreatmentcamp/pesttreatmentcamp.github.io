<p>By completing and making use of an IPM plan, members might be able to save money on pest control methods which were formerly used and can possibly reduce future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Since they are generally more efficient and can typically be used to control numerous pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical category. Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and lower the damage they cause.</p>
<p>Current studies record the requirement for continued decreases in hazardous pesticide use and practices.
