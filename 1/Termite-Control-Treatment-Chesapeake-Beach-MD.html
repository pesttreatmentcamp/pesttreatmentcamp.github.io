<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding disruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>Prior to signing an agreement for pest control, you should be clear about the cost being paid, the services being covered and the presence of cancellation costs, Anti-Pesto says. You can use traps to catch certain pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or illness infection.

Although, originally established for farming pest management, IPM programs are now established to include illness, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of sites such as business and residential structures, lawn and grass locations, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
