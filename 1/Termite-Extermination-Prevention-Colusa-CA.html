<h3>Winter Pest Control Tips Colusa CA</h3>
<p>Although numerous sources specify IPM in various ways, previous designs mainly focused on the ecological, and to some extent on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) identified a lack of a holistic IPM method that uses both modern-day and standard tools.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used only when needed and in mix with other methods for more efficient, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, since they are compatible with other pest management methods, specifically biological control.
