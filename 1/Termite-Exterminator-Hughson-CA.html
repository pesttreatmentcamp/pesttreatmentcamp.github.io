Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
