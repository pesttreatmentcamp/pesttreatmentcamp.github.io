<p>In recommendation to the idea of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to accept collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>When an useful microbe is in a symbiotic relationship with a plant, it will actively secure the plant by discouraging pests and destroying harmful bacteria and fungis. We know how terrifying it can be to have even the tiniest symptom of a bed bug invasion These pests can trigger skin inflammation and interrupt your daily life, and what's worse is they spread out quickly and are difficult to eliminate.
