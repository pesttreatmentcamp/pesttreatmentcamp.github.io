<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of ethical and logical considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed nations.</p>
<p>Some likewise acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might happen, even annual management of a continuous pest could be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who specialize in commercial or commercial pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the foundation for establishment of effective and strong IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>

Most pesticide problems are triggered by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
