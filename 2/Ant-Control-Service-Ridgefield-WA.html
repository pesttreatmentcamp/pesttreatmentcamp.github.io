<p>The very best pest control services in London will be the ones that will remain in your house with the specialised devices and professionals that will be ready for you and for removing those pests. It is a term that describes the way in which growers cultivate and protect their crops based upon an understanding of cycles in and around plants, of balances and relationships of reliance in between plants, insects, nutrients and micro-organisms.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>The best way to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. But home pests can also be a danger to your family. When searching for a location to infest, pests prefer to conceal in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>
