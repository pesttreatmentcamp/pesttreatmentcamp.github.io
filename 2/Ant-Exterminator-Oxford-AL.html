<p>Pesticides are chosen and used in a way that lessens their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in fact need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or packaging, and the facility itself will attract pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
<p>Normally, the main goal of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ).
