<p>The behavior of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
