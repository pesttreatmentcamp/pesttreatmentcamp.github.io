<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about lowering pesticide use.

<p>Environmentally safe: Many biological control representatives are eco-friendly experts. Standards and legislation regarding the use, permitted techniques of application and the storage conditions of chemicals and pesticides vary from nation to nation, typically being enacted laws by each state of territory. Research study and outreach are an essential part of the IPM model to anticipate and determine pest problems, establish curative and preventive strategies, and effectively disseminate the details through standard and contemporary interaction tools and techniques.</p>
