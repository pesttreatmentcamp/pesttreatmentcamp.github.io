<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very effective in triggering substantial decreases in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or saving natural enemy populations by providing havens or preventing practices that hurt them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Normally, the main objective of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for farming pest management, IPM programmes are now established to include illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management objectives of websites such as commercial and residential structures, yard and turf areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
