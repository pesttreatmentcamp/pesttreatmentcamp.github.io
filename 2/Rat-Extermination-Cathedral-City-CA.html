Socio-psychological aspects consisting of logical and moral considerations were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM execution in developed nations.</p>
<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our service technicians inspect your homes for white ants and termites.
