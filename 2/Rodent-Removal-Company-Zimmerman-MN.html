<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dose when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
