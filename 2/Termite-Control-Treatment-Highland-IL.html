<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits including poisonous product will attract and eliminate the pests when distributed in the field or positioned in traps.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in farming, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, grass pest management and decorative pest management. Deal with a pest problem with a hand sprayer, fertilize your yard with a granular spreader, tackle termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with an expert bait gun, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a backpack sprayer.</p>
<p>The expert user must keep using pesticides and other kinds of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by lowered dosages, decreased application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of threat in greenery is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years because fire kills useful insects in addition to the pests and can have a negative impact on the soil. To decrease prospective harm to beneficial insects, limit your spraying to little areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "refuges" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
