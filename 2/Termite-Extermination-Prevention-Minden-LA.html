<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The red imported fire ant is a frustrating and well-known pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Many individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM suggests for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in minimal areas.</p>
<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is based on our four concepts that together we call ERDM. We understand that finding pests in your house or business is traumatic. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control requires time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>

<p>Chemical insecticides were to be used in the way least disruptive to biological control. After handling several nationwide chain exterminators and being largely disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for aid with pest issues at my place of business.

However since these "sex" traps draw in mostly male insects, they aren't very reliable controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A routine tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, regardless of the control methods used.</p>
