<p>Socio-psychological aspects including ethical and rational factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
