<p>WebMD veterinary professionals answer frequently asked questions about fleas and ticks on your pet. Socio-psychological elements including moral and logical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>In referral to the principle of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>

Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry contaminants in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
