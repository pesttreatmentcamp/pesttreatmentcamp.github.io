<p>Socio-psychological aspects including rational and moral considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>In addition to developing clear signs that a pest control program is certainly an IPM system, it is also necessary to provide requirements to measure performance of the system. Usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours is required to perform the general pest control treatment. Public demand is influenced by retail marketing methods, concerns for food security based on pesticide guidelines in their area, and a lack of understanding on food production among other aspects.</p>
<p>The lots of differing threats from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, sugarcane, rice, and soybean.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been regularly using a number of these IPM techniques for years and even generations - methods such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations vulnerable to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its associated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 homeowners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
