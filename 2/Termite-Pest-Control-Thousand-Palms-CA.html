<p>Dorchester County operates a Mosquito Control Program to protect its residents from the spread of mosquito-borne illness by spraying pesticides (insecticides), applying larvicide to low-lying locations, and educating its citizens on reducing the conditions that foster increases in the mosquito population. This combination of IGRs can be reliable in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause major damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complex tasks, are able to use a wider variety of pesticides, and might concentrate on a certain location of pest control.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods along with its variety of inherent strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the possibility that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
