<p>In Asia, various stages of IPM have been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so unbearable sometimes that the only alternative left is to work with a local pest control company to remove pests. If a professional pest control firm is under agreement to an institution, the professional will frequently spray pesticides around the border of different rooms. Hence, incorporated pest management indicates that areawide and long-term approaches can be valuable.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest issues, classical biological control method is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important part of an incorporated pest management programme. However by concentrating on non-chemical alternatives initially, you can guarantee that your pest management program is efficiently getting rid of pests at the least danger to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
