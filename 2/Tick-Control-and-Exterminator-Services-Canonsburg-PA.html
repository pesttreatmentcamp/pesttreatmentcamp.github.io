SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might cause major damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more complicated tasks, have the ability to utilize a wider range of pesticides, and may focus on a specific location of pest control.</p>
