<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely effective in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

Minimizing the use of pesticides is likewise essential as an increasing variety of pests are establishing resistance to chemical pest control. Non target types like natural enemies of pest get affected. June 6, 2020 is World Pest Day, a yearly observance to raise awareness about the essential role that pest control experts play in securing health, food, property and the environment from pest dangers all over the world.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control measures.</p>
