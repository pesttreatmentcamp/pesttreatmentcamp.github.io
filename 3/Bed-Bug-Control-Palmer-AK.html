Use indication plants to determine the effectiveness of pest management methods and to keep an eye on vulnerable crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic spot infection (INSV) and tomato found wilt virus (TSWV).</p>
<p>In the pest control stories, the children found out that farmers use ladybirds to kill aphids on their crops, which a big weed-eating underwater mammal (the manatee) is used by river authorities to keep waterways clear for boats. Requirements of plagued areas and separated application of plant defense items decrease the damage for people and nature as chemicals are used just when it is actually needed.</p>
