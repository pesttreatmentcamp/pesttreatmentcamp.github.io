<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a duration of about 10 years, generally among scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are often monocultures, including a single crop species, which produces a homogenous habitat often lacking essential requirements of natural enemies, thus preferring pest species.</p>
<p>We got 195 mention of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are drawn in to a number of locations that can supply any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all three. If a lot of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be used as the last resort, in principle, in some cases they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to secure the seed and transplants from common and relentless pest problems.</p>
