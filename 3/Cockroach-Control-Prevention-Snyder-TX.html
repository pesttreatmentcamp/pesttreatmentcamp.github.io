<p>Since of their possible harm to pest control employees, clients, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are heavily regulated by Federal law. Fungi: Beauveria bassiana is utilized for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions in between crop and pest (in addition to the environment) are very crucial. Promotion of natural opponents: Not utilizing pesticides and diversifying crops advantages natural opponents of cotton pests such as birds, ladybirds, beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, bugs and ants.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics should be measured using indications based on tracking of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and influence on the environment.
