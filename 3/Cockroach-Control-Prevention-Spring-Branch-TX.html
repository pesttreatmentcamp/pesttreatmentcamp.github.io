<p>Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally taking place compounds (e.g.-- pyrethrum, nicotine and insect juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active element may be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. Most scientists concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
