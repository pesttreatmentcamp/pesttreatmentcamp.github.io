<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about lowering pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
