<p>We historically have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods in addition to its range of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>The human action depends upon the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely get rid of the pest.
