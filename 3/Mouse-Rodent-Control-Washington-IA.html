Learning about the pests you have and alternatives that are readily available to control specific pests is the initial step.</p>
<p>A particular pest can be managed by specific choices, however they may not all be available in a specific location, for a specific crop, or within the available financial ways. IPM involves utilizing the very best mix of cultural, chemical and biological measures for specific scenarios, including plant biotechnology as proper.
