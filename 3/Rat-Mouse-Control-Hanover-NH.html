Review previous pest problems and current pesticide application approaches and make a note of crops growing in nearby greenhouses or outdoors.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is generally utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been successfully utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
