<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the experts.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the concept of incorporating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Likewise, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the exact same location might influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control pertains to non-lethal approaches too, such as keeping the area clean and free of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of a door and the floor.</p>
<p>There are various pest management tactics to reduce pests. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process for handling pests in an effective, economical and environmentally sound way. Although particular crop production and protection strategies are considered exclusive details, sharing knowledge and resources with each other will improve pest control efficacy and benefit the whole grower neighborhood.</p>
