In fact, pest management is involved with the security of our health, our foods and the protection of our property.</p>

<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have actually stopped working.
