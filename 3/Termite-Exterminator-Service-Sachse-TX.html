<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and recognize them precisely, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the significant pattern has been toward the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these means are still rehabs.</p>
