<p>Numerous newer pesticides are stemmed from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- nicotine, pyrethrum and bug juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active component might be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. A lot of researchers concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>A technique that includes the use of pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars developed through conventional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that minimize the plant's appearance or suitability for the pest to feed, establish, or reproduce effectively.</p>
<p>At the core of IPM is the desire to lower pesticide use and human incursion into the ecosystem unless monitoring of pest populations suggests intervention is needed.
